# Heart-Disease-Prediction
We have built Machine Learning (ML) system to help practitioners in heart disease detection and prediction. We illustrated how machine learning can help predict whether a person will develop a heart disease or not. We used seven different ML models and we fitted them with hearts dataset obtained from Kaggle. Then we test and 
evaluate them using the test dataset, and finally we choose our champion model.
